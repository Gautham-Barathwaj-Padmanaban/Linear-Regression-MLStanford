# Linear-Regression-AndewNg-Python
The first programming assignment of the Machine Learning Course offered by Andrew Ng on coursera done in python instead of matlab.

It performs the linear regression algorithm using a vectorized gradient descent approach. 

At the end of the code, a new input can be entered to get the predicted output.

Pandas and Numpy libraries were used for this purpose
